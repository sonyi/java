'Unreliable' Ecclestone wins F1 case
Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has denied bribery charges at the start of his trial in Munich.

He is accused of giving a $45m (£27.5m; 33m euros) bribe to a German banker to secure the sale of a stake in the F1 business to a company he favoured.

Mr Ecclestone admits paying Gerhard Gribkowsky, who is serving a jail sentence for receiving the payment, but has denied any wrongdoing.

He continues to run the F1 business on a day-to-day basis despite the charges.

To alleviate his workload, however, Mr Ecclestone has stood down from a number of F1-related positions until the case concludes.

As the trial began, his lawyers issued a brief statement confirming that he would fight to clear his name.

"The alleged bribery never happened. The prosecution's claims are based on statements by Dr Gribkowsky, which are wrong, misleading and not conclusive," the statement read.
